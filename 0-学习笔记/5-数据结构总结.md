# HllSketch
This is a high performance implementation of Phillipe Flajolets HLL sketch but with significantly improved error behavior.  If the ONLY use case for sketching is counting uniques and merging, the HLL sketch the HLL sketch is a reasonable choice, although the highest performing in terms of accuracy for storage space consumed is CPC (Compressed Probabilistic Counting). For large enough counts, this HLL version (with HLL_4) can be 2 to 16 times smaller than the Theta sketch family for the same accuracy.

This implementation offers three different types of HLL sketch, each with different trade-offs with accuracy, space and performance. These types are specified with the {@link TgtHllType} parameter.

In terms of accuracy, all three types, for the same lgConfigK, have the same error distribution as a function of n, the number of unique values fed to the sketch.  The configuration parameter lgConfigK is the log-base-2 of K, where K is the number of buckets or slots for the sketch.

During warmup, when the sketch has only received a small number of unique items (up to about 10% of K), this implementation leverages a new class of estimator algorithms with significantly better accuracy.  

This sketch also offers the capability of operating off-heap. Given a WritableMemory object created by the user, the sketch will perform all of its updates and internal phase transitions in that object, which can actually reside either on-heap or off-heap based on how it is configured. In large systems that must update and merge many millions of sketches, having the sketch operate off-heap avoids the serialization and deserialization costs of moving sketches
to and from off-heap memory-mapped files, for example, and eliminates big garbage collection delays.


就精读而言：精度而言，对于相同的lgConfigK，这三种类型的误差分布都是n的函数，n是输入到草图的唯一值的数目
配置参数lgConfigK = ln(k)/ln(2)，其中K是草图的存储桶或插槽数，桶的数量。
